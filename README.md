# Hey, I'm Alqma 👋

Software Engineer building scalable backend systems and full-stack applications. Currently focused on backend development with Node.js, NestJS, and PostgreSQL.

## What I'm Working With

**Backend**
- Node.js, NestJS, Express, Fastify
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Drizzle ORM, Prisma
- Docker, RESTful APIs
- ts-rest for type-safe APIs

**Frontend**
- React, Next.js, TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Tanstack Query, Tanstack Router
- Zod for validation

**Currently Learning**
- Go
- Kubernetes
- System design and distributed systems

## What Drives Me

I'm interested in building systems that handle real traffic and real problems. My goal is to work on products where I can learn about scaling, microservices, and distributed architectures. Right now, I'm strengthening my backend skills and exploring Go to expand my understanding of high-performance systems.

Most of my work involves building authentication systems, RESTful APIs, and integrating various services. I'm comfortable working across the stack but find myself increasingly drawn to backend challenges.

## Recent Focus

- Migrating projects from MongoDB to PostgreSQL
- Building type-safe APIs with NestJS and ts-rest
- Exploring Go for backend development
- Learning Kubernetes for container orchestration
